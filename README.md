# RichaAV-UK-housing-price-dynamics-analysis
Analysis of UK housing price dynamics using D3.js, focusing on trends, regional comparisons, and the relationship between incomes, mortgages, and house prices.

This visualization project explores the dynamics of UK housing 
prices through a comprehensive analysis of house price data.  Using 
D3.js and data the project visualizes regional variations, trends over 
time, and the impact of property types on pricing.  
1 PART 1: ANALYTICS 
1.1 Part 1 a. Exploratory Research Questions 
Proposed 
1.1.1 Question 1  
Q1. Analyze the development of house prices over time. Are 
there any detectable trends? 
This question analyse the overall trend of the UK house price over 
different regions over time. 
1.1.2  Question 2 
Q2. How has the relationship between average incomes, 
mortgage advances, and house prices evolved in different UK 
regions from 1986 to 2023, and what does this indicate about 
the regional disparities in housing affordability during this 
period? 
This question analyses the disparity in housing affordability seems 
to be pronounced across regions. London shows the greatest 
growth in house prices, indicating a potentially higher strain on 
affordability in the capital compared to other regions. Other 
regions have seen growth in house prices as well, but perhaps not 
as dramatically when compared to London. 
1.1.3  Question 3 
Q3. How have average house prices for different types of 
dwellings (Bungalow, Detached, Semi-detached, Terraced, Flat 
or Maisonette) varied across UK regions over the period from 
1986 to 2023, and what patterns can be observed in terms of 
regional price growth and housing type preferences? 
This visualization of this question shows that across all regions, 
there has been a significant increase in the average house prices 
for all dwelling types over the period from 1986 to 2023. Also, 
from the graphs it is evident that Detached houses consistently 
held the highest average price among dwelling types across all 
regions, indicating a strong preference or value placed on this type 
of dwelling.
